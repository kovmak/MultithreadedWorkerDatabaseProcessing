## Overview

The Multithreaded Worker Database Processing project is aimed at exploring multithreaded processing techniques in Java, particularly focusing on database interactions. It involves generating a large dataset of workers and performing various data processing tasks concurrently using multiple threads.

## Task

The main task of this project is to generate a substantial number of worker records and utilize multithreading to efficiently process and analyze the data. The project includes tasks such as calculating average salary, finding workers with specific qualifications, determining the total number of hours worked, and more.

## Database Schema

The database schema for this project includes a `workers` table with attributes such as ID, first name, last name, age, gender, education, experience, salary, and hours worked. This table stores the generated worker data for processing.

## Implementation

The implementation of this project involves the following key components:

- Data generation: Utilizing libraries such as JFairy or JavaFaker to generate realistic worker data.
- Multithreaded processing: Implementing concurrency to perform various data processing tasks simultaneously for improved efficiency.
- Database interaction: Using JDBC to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the worker records.

## Testing

Testing is conducted to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the implemented multithreaded processing. Unit tests are written to verify the functionality of individual components, while integration tests validate the system as a whole.
